High-performance trading bot powered by analytics.

# Prerequisities

- A processor & some electricity
- Preferably Linux distro
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- Faith.
- & an RPC provider, current fastest: https://apewise.org

## Features

- Check current consensus leader's location to make decisions 
- A Postgre database hooked into Pump.fun and Pump.fun AMM
- Integrated SWQoS Services:
  - Blox
  - Jito
  - Helius
  - Temporal
  - ZeroSlot
  - NextBlock
- Durable nonce when using SWQoS
- Choose between gRPC or Websocket
- Plug-n-play trading strategies:
   - Deagles - Creators who funded their wallet (or sub-wallet) with more than X SOL **using CEX**
   - VolCreators - Creators from analytics, sorted by volume
   - GrandChillers - ...sorted by highest market cap
   - Digged - Doesn't use analytics, checks if the muber of transactions between first and n slot from mint's creation is higher or equal to configured number
   - Dip - Enter into dips of migrated Pump.fun tokens
   - DevBestFriend - Enter only if the dev is alone in his slot after 100ms, avoids bundlers
- Configurable trading filters (see `.env`)
- Avoids duplicate tokens in both analytics and trading
- Calculates best priority fee for the transaction

## Setup

### Download the repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/FLOCK4H/Mew-X
$ cd Mew-X
```

### Create databases

```bash
$ psql -U your_postgre_user
$ > CREATE DATABASE vacation;
$ > CREATE DATABASE goldmine;
```

Tables will be created on launch.

### Configure the `.env` file

### Build & run the project

```
$ cargo run
```

First, Mew will fetch locations of nodes participating in the cluster. **Indexing of (at the time of writing) 6000+ validators takes around 1.5 hour, we do that to speed up the location checks when trading.**

```bash
Indexing HrLAr7y9k8qYd14uF5KdTz5z9p9BvZuf1o6cKY255wtD @ 80.240.31.38 -> ("Frankfurt", "Germany")
Indexing B7PbdWDgqc5h5rbTyi5Yyz2e1DJZEMoM3uXoqobk35n9 @ 202.8.11.203 -> ("Singapore", "Singapore")
Indexing Apt9PHrFBt1sji788VzwBYpYensM43eA6qLVybqZrKak @ 65.21.90.166 -> ("Helsinki", "Finland")
```

### (Optional) Development

There are lots of tests in `sol.rs` of `sol_hook`, to save you some trouble here is the command:

```bash
$ cargo test mew::sol_hook::sol::tests::test_pump_buy -- --exact --no-capture
```
